# Pre-Decision Checklist

## Overview

Checklists are among the most powerful debiasing tools available. Research shows that systematic pre-decision checklists can improve decision quality by 30-50% across domains from medicine to business strategy. The key is using them **before** the decision, not after.

**When to use this skill:**
- Before any high-stakes decision (hiring, investment, strategic pivot)
- When Quick Recognition flags multiple biases
- Before major commitments (contracts, projects, partnerships)
- During strategic planning sessions
- When group decisions involve significant resources or risk

**Why checklists work:**
- Force explicit consideration of blind spots
- Slow down System 1 thinking
- Create documentation for post-decision review
- Reduce overconfidence through structured analysis
- Make implicit biases explicit

**Research evidence:**
- WHO study: Surgical checklists reduce complications 38% and mortality 47%
- Schmidt & Hunter meta-analysis: Structured interviews reduce hiring errors 50%
- Klein research: Pre-mortems improve problem identification 30%
- Kahneman's quality control: Used by McKinsey and Fortune 500 companies

## Universal Pre-Decision Checklist

Use this checklist for **all** significant decisions, regardless of domain. Allow 5-10 minutes minimum. Write down your answers.

### 1. Information Quality
**Question:** "Have I actively sought disconfirming evidence?"

**Bias:** [[Confirmation Bias]]

**Action:** List 3 reasons this decision might be wrong. Find sources that disagree with your preferred option.

---

### 2. Anchoring Check
**Question:** "What was the first number/option I heard? Am I biased by it?"

**Bias:** [[Anchoring Bias]]

**Action:** Generate estimate independently before seeing any anchors. If already anchored, deliberately consider extreme alternatives (10x higher/lower, opposite choice).

---

### 3. Reference Class
**Question:** "What happened in similar situations? What's the base rate?"

**Biases:** [[Base Rate Neglect]], [[Availability Heuristic]]

**Action:** Identify 5-10 comparable cases. Calculate success rate. Don't assume your case is exceptional without evidence.

---

### 4. Alternatives Generation
**Question:** "Have I generated at least 3 genuine alternatives?"

**Biases:** [[Status Quo Bias]], [[Loss Aversion]], [[Premature Closure]]

**Action:** Force yourself to develop 3+ options. If you're choosing between "do it" and "don't do it," you don't have real alternatives yet.

---

### 5. Emotion Check
**Question:** "Am I deciding based on emotion or analysis?"

**Bias:** Affect Heuristic, [[Peak-End Rule]]

**Action:** Rate emotional intensity 1-10. If >7, delay decision 24 hours. Separate "how does this feel?" from "what does the data say?"

---

### 6. Outside View
**Question:** "What would an outsider advise? What would I tell a friend?"

**Biases:** [[Bias Blind Spot]], [[Overconfidence Bias]]

**Action:** Explicitly role-play: "If a friend came to me with this exact situation, what would I tell them?" Document the difference.

---

### 7. Time Horizon
**Question:** "Will I regret this in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?"

**Bias:** Temporal Discounting, [[Recency Bias]]

**Action:** Use the 10/10/10 rule (Suzy Welch). Consider near-term, medium-term, and long-term consequences separately.

---

### 8. Reversibility
**Question:** "Can I undo this? If not, have I slowed down?"

**Bias:** [[Loss Aversion]], [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]]

**Action:** Type 1 decisions (irreversible): slow down, gather more data. Type 2 decisions (reversible): decide faster, iterate.

---

### 9. Incentive Alignment
**Question:** "Do my advisors have aligned incentives? Cui bono?"

**Bias:** [[Authority Bias]], [[Affinity Bias]]

**Action:** Map stakeholder incentives. Who benefits from which outcome? Discount advice from non-aligned sources.

---

### 10. Documentation
**Question:** "Have I written down my reasoning before the outcome?"

**Bias:** [[Hindsight Bias]], [[Overconfidence Bias]]

**Action:** Document: (1) what you predict will happen, (2) your confidence level, (3) your reasoning. Date it. Review after outcome.

---

## Domain-Specific Checklists

### Hiring & Recruitment Checklist

**Use when:** Interviewing candidates, making hiring decisions

**Key biases:** [[Halo Effect]], [[Affinity Bias]], [[Confirmation Bias]], [[Fundamental Attribution Error]]

1. **Structured interviews:** Use the same questions for all candidates. Score independently before discussion.

2. **Pre-defined scorecard:** Weight criteria before meeting candidates. What matters: skills, culture, potential? Assign weights.

3. **Blind resume review:** Remove names, photos, university names. Focus on skills and achievements.

4. **Multiple independent interviewers:** Each interviewer forms opinion separately before group discussion. Avoid [[Groupthink]].

5. **Compare to role, not to each other:** Rate each candidate against job requirements, not against other candidates (avoid [[Decoy Effect]]).

6. **Define "culture fit" explicitly:** What specific values/behaviors? Write them down. "I like them" is [[Affinity Bias]], not culture fit.

7. **Work sample tests:** Simulate actual work. Best predictor of performance (Schmidt & Hunter: r=0.54 validity).

8. **Reference class forecasting:** How have similar candidates performed historically in this role?

---

### Strategic/Executive Checklist (Kahneman's 12-Point)

**Use when:** Major strategic decisions, executive planning, large investments

**Key biases:** [[Groupthink]], [[Overconfidence Bias]], [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]], [[Planning Fallacy]]

1. **Self-interested biases:** Are there reasons for anyone to distort information? Who benefits from which outcome?

2. **Affect heuristic:** Has the team fallen in love with their proposal? Are we deciding with emotions?

3. **Groupthink prevention:** Were dissenting opinions heard and seriously explored? Did anyone play devil's advocate?

4. **Halo effect check:** Is the presenter's credibility deserved? Or based on past success in a different domain?

5. **Independent anchoring:** Were estimates made independently before group discussion? Or did first speaker anchor everyone?

6. **Availability bias:** Are we overweighting risks because they're salient/recent/dramatic rather than statistically significant?

7. **Sunk cost fallacy:** Would we choose this course if starting fresh today? Are we throwing good money after bad?

8. **Planning fallacy:** Have we used the outside view? What's the reference class? Add safety margins (time +50%, budget +25%).

9. **Pre-mortem:** If this failed spectacularly, what would the cause be? Work backwards from failure.

10. **Competitor neglect:** What will competitors do in response? Have we modeled their reactions?

11. **Worst-case scenario:** What's the worst plausible outcome? Can we survive it? Is the risk acceptable?

12. **Devil's advocate:** Did we formally assign someone to argue against the proposal? Did we take them seriously?

---

### Investment Checklist

**Use when:** Financial investments, M&A decisions, capital allocation

**Key biases:** [[Loss Aversion]], [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]], [[Overconfidence Bias]], [[Anchoring Bias]]

1. **Base rates and reference class:** What percentage of similar investments succeeded? Don't assume yours is special.

2. **Pre-mortem on failure:** If this investment fails, what will be the most likely cause? List 5 failure modes.

3. **Outside view from non-invested party:** Get opinion from someone with no skin in the game. They see biases you don't.

4. **Loss aversion check:** Am I avoiding selling a loser because I don't want to realize the loss? Sunk costs are sunk.

5. **Sunk cost awareness:** How much have I already invested (time/money/ego)? Would I invest this amount today starting fresh?

6. **Diversification:** Am I over-concentrated in one sector/geography/asset? What's my actual risk exposure?

7. **Time horizon clarity:** What's my investment timeline? Short-term volatility OK if long-term thesis intact?

8. **Exit criteria defined:** At what point do I sell (up or down)? Define before emotions kick in.

---

### Project Management Checklist

**Use when:** Project planning, timeline estimation, resource allocation

**Key biases:** [[Planning Fallacy]], [[Optimism Bias]], [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]], [[Groupthink]]

1. **Planning fallacy mitigation:** Take initial time estimate and add 50%. Use reference class of similar projects.

2. **Pre-mortem facilitation:** "It's 6 months from now and the project failed. What happened?" Brainstorm failure modes.

3. **Risk identification first:** List risks before planning mitigation. Don't skip straight to solutions.

4. **Independent estimation:** Team members estimate time/resources independently before group discussion.

5. **Groupthink prevention:** Anonymous feedback mechanisms. Encourage dissent. Reward people who spot problems.

6. **Sunk cost checkpoints:** Build go/no-go decision points. If criteria aren't met, stop the project.

7. **Resource buffer:** Don't allocate team at 100% capacity. Life happens. Plan for 70-80% utilization.

8. **Scope definition:** What's explicitly out of scope? Prevents scope creep and [[Loss Aversion]] ("we've come this far...").

---

### Medical/Clinical Checklist

**Use when:** Diagnosis, treatment decisions, patient care planning

**Key biases:** [[Availability Heuristic]], [[Anchoring Bias]], [[Confirmation Bias]], [[Premature Closure]]

1. **Comprehensive differential:** List 5+ possible diagnoses before settling on one. Don't anchor on first hypothesis.

2. **Disconfirming evidence:** What findings would rule out my leading diagnosis? Actively look for them.

3. **Availability check:** Am I thinking of this diagnosis because I saw a similar case recently? Or because it's actually likely?

4. **Base rates:** What's the prevalence of this condition in this population? Rare diseases are rare.

5. **Second opinion:** For complex/high-risk cases, consult colleague before finalizing treatment plan.

6. **Diagnostic reflection:** Pause and ask: "What else could this be? What am I missing?"

7. **Patient involvement:** Have I explained options clearly? Ensured informed consent? Checked understanding?

8. **Time-out before procedures:** Verify patient, procedure, site. Simple checklist prevents catastrophic errors.

## How to Use This Skill

### Before Decision (Critical)
- Use checklists **before** deciding, not to justify decision already made
- Allow minimum 5-10 minutes (complex decisions: 30-60 minutes)
- Don't skip questions that feel irrelevant—those often reveal blind spots

### During Use
- **Write down answers:** Don't just think them. Writing forces clarity and creates documentation.
- **Be honest:** Checklist only works if you're truthful about biases. No one else needs to see this.
- **Generate specifics:** "Have I considered alternatives?" → "Alternative 1: X, Alternative 2: Y, Alternative 3: Z"

### For Group Decisions
- Share checklist with team beforehand
- Each person completes independently first
- Discuss findings together, especially disagreements
- Assign devil's advocate role explicitly

### After Decision
- Keep checklist with decision documentation
- Review during post-mortems: "Which biases did we miss?"
- Update personal checklist based on lessons learned

## Customization Guidelines

**Create your own domain checklist:**

1. **Identify top 5-8 biases in your field:** Review past decisions. What errors repeat?
2. **Convert to questions:** Make each bias a checkable question
3. **Add domain-specific actions:** What specifically should you do to counter each bias?
4. **Test and refine:** Use for 10 decisions, note what works and what doesn't
5. **Share with team:** Best checklists are collaborative

**Example domains needing custom checklists:**
- Software architecture decisions
- Marketing campaign planning
- Product roadmap prioritization
- Legal case strategy
- Research study design
- Budget allocation
- Partnership negotiations

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using checklist to justify pre-made decision:** Defeats the purpose. Use before deciding.
2. **Rushing through questions:** Takes 5-10 minutes minimum. If you're going faster, you're not thinking.
3. **Only thinking answers, not writing them:** Writing forces precision and creates documentation.
4. **Skipping "irrelevant" questions:** Those often reveal your blind spots.
5. **Using alone for group decisions:** Everyone should complete independently first.
6. **Not reviewing after outcome:** You don't learn without feedback loop.
7. **Making checklist too long:** 5-12 items is optimal. Longer checklists get ignored.

## Final Thoughts

The checklist is not a substitute for judgment—it's a tool to improve judgment. The goal is not to eliminate all biases (impossible), but to make them explicit and manageable.

As Atul Gawande writes: "We don't like checklists. They can be painstaking. They're not much fun. But I don't think the issue here is mere laziness. There's something deeper, more visceral going on when people walk away not only from saving lives but from making money. It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an embarrassment. It runs counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly great among us—those we aspire to be—handle situations of high stakes and complexity. The truly great are daring. They improvise. They do not have protocols and checklists."

But the evidence is overwhelming: checklists work. They save lives, improve decisions, and reduce errors. Use them.

**Time investment:** 5-10 minutes before decision
**Error reduction:** 30-50% across domains
**Cost:** Zero
**Barrier:** Ego

Choose wisely.
