# Quick Bias Recognition

## Overview

Your brain takes shortcuts to process information quickly, but these shortcuts create systematic errors—cognitive biases. These biases happen automatically, especially under pressure, emotion, or time constraints.

This skill provides a 2-minute diagnostic to identify which cognitive bias you're experiencing in real-time during decisions. It's organized around the Benson framework's four categories: how we filter information, fill in gaps, rush to act, and misremember. Use this when you sense something's off with your thinking but can't pinpoint what.

The goal isn't perfect rationality—it's awareness. Once you recognize which bias is active, you can compensate with specific techniques or seek outside perspective on that particular blind spot.

## When to Use

**Use this diagnostic when:**
- Making high-stakes decisions (hiring, investing, major purchases)
- Feeling strong emotion (anger, excitement, fear) during decision
- Experiencing disagreement with others about "obvious" facts
- Time pressure forcing quick commitment
- "Gut feeling" driving choice without clear reasoning
- Stuck between options with no clear path forward

**Symptoms you're experiencing bias:**
- Dismissing contradictory evidence quickly
- Feeling absolute certainty despite limited information
- Defending a position more vigorously than facts warrant
- Remembering events differently than others present
- Making assumptions that "feel true" without verification

**When NOT to use:**
- Routine decisions with low stakes
- When you have time for [[Pre-Decision Checklist]] (more thorough)
- Decisions requiring deep research ([[Deep Dive Research]])
- Situations where speed matters more than accuracy

## The 4-Category Diagnostic

Work through these four categories in order. When symptoms match, check the quick questions to confirm which specific bias is active.

### Category 1: Am I Filtering Information?

**What's happening:** Your brain is selectively paying attention to some information while ignoring other data.

**Symptoms:**
- Seeking evidence that confirms what you already believe
- Ignoring or dismissing contradictory data
- Remembering recent examples vividly, assuming they're representative
- Focusing on first piece of information received (price, estimate, claim)
- Noticing information that supports existing position

**Suspect biases:**
- [[Confirmation Bias]] - Seeking confirming evidence, dismissing contradictory
- [[Availability Heuristic]] - Overweighting recent/vivid examples
- [[Recency Bias]] - Most recent information dominates thinking
- [[Anchoring Bias]] - First number/fact locks in reference point

**Quick check questions:**
1. "What evidence would change my mind? Am I actively seeking it?"
2. "Am I overweighting recent or vivid examples?"
3. "Is the first piece of information I received anchoring my thinking?"
4. "What contradictory data am I dismissing? Why?"

**Red flags:** "Everyone I talk to agrees with me" (selection), "This just happened to someone I know" (availability), "The initial estimate was X, so Y seems reasonable" (anchoring)

### Category 2: Am I Filling in Gaps?

**What's happening:** Your brain is making assumptions and jumping to conclusions to create coherent stories from incomplete information.

**Symptoms:**
- Making assumptions without realizing you're assuming
- Jumping to conclusions about people's motives or character
- Seeing patterns where none exist
- Stereotyping based on limited data
- Creating coherent narratives from sparse facts
- Feeling certain about things you don't actually know

**Suspect biases:**
- [[WYSIATI]] (What You See Is All There Is) - Assuming you have all relevant information
- [[Fundamental Attribution Error]] - Blaming character, ignoring circumstances
- [[Halo Effect]] - One positive trait colors everything positively
- [[Framing Effect]] - How information is presented determines interpretation

**Quick check questions:**
1. "What am I assuming without direct evidence?"
2. "What information am I missing? What don't I know?"
3. "Am I attributing behavior to character vs. circumstances?"
4. "Is one positive/negative trait coloring my entire judgment?"
5. "Would I see this differently if framed another way?"

**Red flags:** "It's obvious that..." (assumption), "They did X because they're Y type of person" (attribution), "They're great at A so they'll be great at B" (halo)

### Category 3: Am I Rushing to Act?

**What's happening:** Your brain is pushing toward quick action, maintaining current course, or defending past decisions.

**Symptoms:**
- Feeling time pressure to decide (even when there isn't)
- Overconfidence in estimates or predictions
- Resisting change from current situation
- Defending or justifying past decisions
- Throwing good money/time after bad
- Fear of loss outweighing potential gain
- "Can't stop now after all this work"

**Suspect biases:**
- [[Overconfidence Bias]] - Overestimating accuracy of judgments
- [[Loss Aversion]] - Fear of loss stronger than desire for equivalent gain
- [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]] - Continuing because you've already invested
- [[Status Quo Bias]] - Preferring current state, resisting change
- [[Commitment Bias]] - Defending past commitments

**Quick check questions:**
1. "Am I being overconfident in my estimates? What's my confidence range?"
2. "Am I continuing because of past investment vs. future value?"
3. "Would I choose current option if starting fresh today?"
4. "Am I resisting change because change itself feels uncomfortable?"
5. "Am I defending this because I decided it before?"

**Red flags:** "I'm 90% certain" (overconfidence), "We can't quit after investing this much" (sunk cost), "Let's stick with what we have" (status quo), "I can't back down now" (commitment)

### Category 4: Am I Misremembering?

**What's happening:** Your brain is rewriting history to fit current narratives or emphasizing dramatic moments over overall experience.

**Symptoms:**
- "I knew it all along" feeling after outcome is known
- Remembering peak moments and endings, forgetting the middle
- Recent events dominating memory of longer period
- Rewriting what you previously believed
- Remembering your predictions as more accurate than they were

**Suspect biases:**
- [[Hindsight Bias]] - "I knew it all along" after outcome known
- [[Peak-End Rule]] - Judging experience by peak and end, ignoring duration
- [[Recency Bias]] - Recent events dominate memory

**Quick check questions:**
1. "Am I rewriting what I predicted before I knew the outcome?"
2. "Am I judging this experience by the best/worst moments and ending?"
3. "Are recent events making me forget the longer pattern?"
4. "Did I really 'always know' this, or does it just feel that way now?"

**Red flags:** "I always said this would happen" (hindsight), "That vacation was terrible because of the last day" (peak-end), "This always happens" after one recent example (recency)

## Quick Reference Card

Use this one-page summary during decisions:

| Category | Key Question | Top 3 Biases | Fastest Check |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Filtering Info** | What am I ignoring? | Confirmation, Availability, Anchoring | "What would change my mind?" |
| **Filling Gaps** | What am I assuming? | WYSIATI, Attribution Error, Halo | "What don't I know?" |
| **Rushing to Act** | Why the urgency? | Overconfidence, Sunk Cost, Loss Aversion | "Would I choose this starting fresh?" |
| **Misremembering** | Am I rewriting history? | Hindsight, Peak-End Rule | "Did I really predict this?" |

**Universal bias check:** "If someone else made this decision with these same thoughts, what would I tell them?"

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Hiring Decision (Filtering Information)

**Situation:** You're hiring a developer. The first candidate was excellent and asked for $120K. Now interviewing others, and $110K "feels low" while $130K "feels high."

**Symptoms:** Anchoring on first salary number, filtering subsequent candidates through that lens.

**Diagnostic process:**
1. Category 1 check: "Is first information anchoring me?" YES
2. Specific bias: [[Anchoring Bias]]
3. Quick fix: What would I pay if I hadn't seen the first number? Research market rate independently.

**Action:** Look up salary data, create range before seeing candidates, evaluate skills independently of salary discussions.

### Example 2: Product Pricing (Filling in Gaps)

**Situation:** Customer rejected your $50 product. You assume they think it's too expensive and consider dropping price to $30.

**Symptoms:** Making assumptions about why they said no without asking, jumping to price conclusion.

**Diagnostic process:**
1. Category 2 check: "What am I assuming?" That price is the issue
2. Specific bias: [[WYSIATI]] (assuming you have all information)
3. Quick fix: What don't you actually know? Their real reason for declining.

**Action:** Ask customer why they declined before changing price. Might be timing, features, or comparison to alternatives—not price.

### Example 3: Investment Decision (Rushing to Act)

**Situation:** You invested $10K in a failing project. Team suggests cutting losses, but you want to invest another $5K to "make it work."

**Symptoms:** Justifying new investment because of past investment, "can't quit now."

**Diagnostic process:**
1. Category 3 check: "Am I continuing because of past investment?" YES
2. Specific bias: [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]]
3. Quick fix: Would you invest $5K in this if you hadn't already spent $10K?

**Action:** Evaluate the $5K decision independently. Past $10K is gone regardless—focus on whether $5K now creates future value.

### Example 4: Project Retrospective (Misremembering)

**Situation:** Project launched yesterday with bugs. Team member says "I warned about this in planning." You don't remember any warning. Now questioning your judgment.

**Symptoms:** They're rewriting their prediction after seeing the outcome.

**Diagnostic process:**
1. Category 4 check: "Are they rewriting what they predicted?" Possibly
2. Specific bias: [[Hindsight Bias]] ("I knew it all along")
3. Quick fix: Check written records from planning phase.

**Action:** Review meeting notes and chat logs. Did they actually warn about this specific issue, or does it feel that way now that bugs appeared?

### Example 5: Personal Health Decision (Combination)

**Situation:** Friend got sick after eating seafood. Now you're avoiding all seafood despite eating it safely for years.

**Symptoms:** Recent vivid example overriding years of data, pattern-matching from single instance.

**Diagnostic process:**
1. Category 1 check: "Am I overweighting recent example?" YES - [[Availability Heuristic]]
2. Category 2 check: "Am I seeing false pattern?" YES - One instance doesn't make pattern
3. Quick fix: How many times have you eaten seafood safely vs. one friend's bad experience?

**Action:** Consider base rates—thousands of safe seafood meals vs. one problematic one. If concerned, focus on food handling practices, not avoiding entire category.

## When This Skill Is Essential

**High-stakes decisions:**
- Hiring, firing, promotions
- Major purchases (house, car, business equipment)
- Investments (money, time, career moves)
- Medical decisions
- Relationship choices

**Emotional situations:**
- Angry at someone's behavior → [[Fundamental Attribution Error]]
- Excited about opportunity → [[Overconfidence Bias]]
- Fearful of change → [[Loss Aversion]], [[Status Quo Bias]]
- Defensive about past choice → [[Commitment Bias]], [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]]

**Time pressure:**
- "Need to decide now" → Check if urgency is real
- Limited time increases bias activation
- Quick 2-minute diagnostic more valuable than extensive analysis

**Disagreements:**
- You're certain, others disagree → Likely filtering information
- "It's obvious" → Check [[WYSIATI]]
- Remembering events differently → [[Hindsight Bias]]

## Limitations

**This is a quick screening tool, not comprehensive analysis:**
- 2-minute check catches obvious biases, not subtle ones
- You can't see all your own biases (bias blind spot)
- Multiple biases often interact and compound
- Knowing about bias doesn't make you immune

**When you need more:**
- **Systematic review:** Use [[Pre-Decision Checklist]] for thorough analysis
- **Outside perspective:** Get input from others not emotionally invested
- **Deep research:** Use [[Deep Dive Research]] for complex decisions
- **Time:** If you have days/weeks, use more rigorous methods

**After identifying bias:**
- Recognition is step one, not solution
- Need specific debiasing techniques for each bias
- Consider whether decision can wait for less emotional state
- Seek input from people who disagree with you

**Common trap:** Thinking you're immune after learning about biases. You're not. These are automatic processes. Goal is awareness and compensation, not elimination.
